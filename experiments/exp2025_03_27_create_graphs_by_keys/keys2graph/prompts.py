**INSTRUCTIONS FOR ANNOTATION**

1. You will be given a dialogue graph in JSON format.
   - A list of nodes (with id, label, is_start, utterances).
   - A list of edges (with source, target, and user utterances).

2. Produce a single JSON object called "annotation" with the following keys 
   (and ONLY these keys, each filled appropriately or 'unknown'):

   Keys:
   - topic
   Description: the general topic or domain
   Example: "Fixing a calendar sync delay with time zones"

3. The final output MUST be valid JSON in the form:

json
{
  "annotation": {
    "topic": "...",
    "sub_topic": "...",
    ...
    "dynamic_content": "..."
  }
}

4. If any key is not derivable from the graph, use "unknown".

Return ONLY the JSON structure (no code fences or additional commentary).

# Prompt template for fixing invalid JSON
FIX_JSON_INSTRUCTIONS = """
You are given an invalid JSON string. Your job is to fix any syntax issues 
(missing quotes, brackets, commas, etc.) so that it's valid JSON. 
Do not add or remove keys or change the meaning. The JSON is below:

{{BROKEN_JSON}}

Return ONLY the corrected JSON, with no extra commentary, code fences, or text.
"""

GRAPH_GENERATION_INSTRUCTIONS = """
You are given a set of key-value pairs (from an annotation) 
and asked to create a new dialogue graph in JSON format.

- The new graph must have a "nodes" list and an "edges" list.
- Each node has an integer "id", a "label" (string), a boolean "is_start" (optional), 
  and a list of "utterances" (strings) that represent what the bot might say.
- Each edge has "source", "target" (IDs of the nodes), and "utterances" (strings) 
  that represent possible user messages or transitions.

Use the annotation keys to decide the theme, structure, or content. 
For example, if "topic" = "pizza_order", you might create a small flow about ordering pizza.

Return only valid JSON with structure:
{
  "nodes": [...],
  "edges": [...]
}

No extra commentary or text.
