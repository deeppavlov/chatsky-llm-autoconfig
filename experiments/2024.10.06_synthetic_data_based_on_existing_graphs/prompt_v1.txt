Your task is to create dialogue based on a graph describing this dialogue. The dialogues must be written in english, consist of exactly two people talking, show user-assistant interaction and be cycled (the last phrase should connect last node with first node). You have an example of dialogue from customer chatbot system. You also have an example of set of rules how chatbot system works should be looking - it is a set of nodes when chatbot system respons and a set of transitions that are triggered by user requests. 
    Here is the example of set of rules: 
```
    'edges': [{ 'source': 1, 'target': 2, 'utterances': 'I need to make an order' }, 
    { 'source': 1, 'target': 2, 'utterances': 'I want to order from you' }, 
    { 'source': 2, 'target': 3, 'utterances': 'I would like to purchase 'Pale Fire' and 'Anna Karenina', please' }, 
    'nodes': [ {'id': 1, 'label': 'start', 'is_start': true, 'utterances': [ 'How can I help?', 'Hello' ]}, 
    { 'id': 2, 'label': 'ask_books', 'is_start': false, 'utterances': [ 'What books do you like?'} ] 
```
You will have to create a dialogue. It must be sensible, grammatically and logically correct and correspond to the dialogue graph. Here is the graph you must describe as a dialogue and example dialogue.

This is the end of the example. We encourage you to use cycles and complex interwining structure of the graph with 'Yes'/'No' edges for the branching. Themes of dialogues must be original and not exactly about literature or buying stuff as long as they are sensible and follow rules. Dialogue and graph must be valid JSON strings. Return ONLY JSON string in plain text (no code blocks) without any additional commentaries.
