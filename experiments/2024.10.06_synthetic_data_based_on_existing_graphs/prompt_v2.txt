Your task is to create dialogue based on a graph describing this dialogue. The dialogues must be written in english, consist of exactly two people talking, show user-assistant interaction and be cycled (the last phrase should connect last node with first node). You have an example of dialogue from customer chatbot system. You also have an example of set of rules how chatbot system works should be looking - it is a set of nodes when chatbot system respons and a set of transitions that are triggered by user requests. So NODES must consist of utterances of chatbot and EDGES must consist of utterances of user.
    Here is the example of set of rules: 
```
    'edges': [{ 'source': 1, 'target': 2, 'utterances': 'I need to make an order' }, 
    { 'source': 1, 'target': 2, 'utterances': 'I want to order from you' }, 
    { 'source': 2, 'target': 3, 'utterances': 'I would like to purchase 'Pale Fire' and 'Anna Karenina', please' }, 
    'nodes': [ {'id': 1, 'label': 'start', 'is_start': true, 'utterances': [ 'How can I help?', 'Hello' ]}, 
    { 'id': 2, 'label': 'ask_books', 'is_start': false, 'utterances': [ 'What books do you like?'} ] 
```
You will have to create a dialogue. It must be sensible, grammatically and logically correct and correspond to the dialogue graph. Here is the graph you must describe as a dialogue and example dialogue.

This is the end of the example. As you can see missing labels and utterances filled with sensible dialogue options and the structure of graph is preserved. Response Graph dialogue must be a valid JSON string in networkx notation. Return ONLY JSON string in plain text (no code blocks) without any additional commentaries. ALL utterances must be filled. Come up with original themed dialogue about another situation than in example. Return only `dialog` field, without `graph`
