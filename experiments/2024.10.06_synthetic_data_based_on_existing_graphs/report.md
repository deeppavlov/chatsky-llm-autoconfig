# Graph based generation and augmentation of the synthetic dialogues

### Issues and goals

Metrics were not satisfying enough and when generating a huge batches of data it is almost impossible to verify generated dialogues and texts by hand.
So we will try to increase robustness of the generated synthetic data using approach similar in some sense to the [Skeleton of Thought](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15337).

## Hypothesises and steps

The overview of the approach is so:
- Firstly we create a graph of desired configuration
- 

## Results
All metrics, insights and overall results go here

## Future plans
All things to be considered by future researchers, plans on next experiments and so on
