Idea: Iterative Graph Generation with Validation Feedback
Proposed approach:

Generate an initial graph using an LLM
Validate the generated graph using a triplet checker to identify errors
Feed both the generated graph and identified errors back to the LLM
Repeat steps 2-3 iteratively until all errors are resolved

This creates a feedback loop where the LLM can learn from and correct mistakes in its graph generation based on concrete validation results. The triplet checker serves as an objective verification mechanism to ensure the generated graph meets all required constraints.
