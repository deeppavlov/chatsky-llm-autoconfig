Invalid transition from ['Please try charging the device and ensure the power source is working.'] to ['Please try the suggested steps and let me know if it helps.'] via edge '[\"Okay, I'll try that\"]': The transition is invalid because the assistant is repeating the same instruction to try the suggested steps after the user has already agreed to do so. Invalid transition from ['Great! Is there anything else I can help you with?'] to [\"I'm glad to hear that! Is there anything else I can assist you with?\"] via edge '['Yes, it helped']': The user's response 'Yes, it helped' does not logically follow the assistant's question 'Is there anything else I can help you with?'.

Invalid transition from ['Please try restarting the device and closing any unused applications.'] to ['Please try the suggested steps and let me know if it helps.'] via edge '[\"Okay, I'll try that\"]': The assistant's next phrase is invalid because it is redundant.
