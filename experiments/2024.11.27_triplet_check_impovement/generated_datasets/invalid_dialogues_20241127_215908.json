Invalid transition from ['Please try charging the device and ensure the power source is working.'] to ['Please try the suggested steps and let me know if it helps.'] via edge '[\"Okay, I'll try that\"]': The transition is invalid because the assistant is repeating the same instruction to try the suggested steps after the user has already agreed to do so. Invalid transition from ['Great! Is there anything else I can help you with?'] to [\"I'm glad to hear that! Is there anything else I can assist you with?\"] via edge '['Yes, it helped']': The user's response 'Yes, it helped' does not logically follow the assistant's question 'Is there anything else I can help you with?'. The assistant's next phrase also does not logically follow the user's response. Invalid transition from ['Please try restarting the device and closing any unused applications.'] to ['Please try the suggested steps and let me know if it helps.'] via edge '[\"Okay, I'll try that\"]': The assistant's next phrase is invalid because it is redundant. The user has already acknowledged the assistant's initial suggestion to restart the device and close unused applications, so there's no need for the assistant to repeat the same instruction."
